<!-- Screenshots -->
### :camera: Screenshots

When you first arrive to the site, you are greated with a log-in page where you can navigate to a sign up page if you don't already have an account. The website will track your clinic and meetup registrations to your username.

The screenshot below shows the Clinics Page, where you can see the list of local coaches offering clinics, and you can register for the ones of your choosing.

Once registering for a clinic or public meetup, you can head to your "my schedule" page where you can see your registrations, and you can unregister for those events should you change your mind.
